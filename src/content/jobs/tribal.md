This was my first job in the industry. I was contracted by a teacher at my university to work in a project of
his company. My main role was a as front-end developer to add functionality to an existing application,
it was an application to register fumigations on the fields.

My main objective in the project was to extend some functionality to the web interface that was
already available in the mobile application (because it wasn't working in some devices).
The biggest challenge that I experienced was trying to understand the already done back-end,
because it was quite a big application with no documentation about the back-end endpoints.

What I learned here:

- How to deal to an existing application by myself
- Many principles about UX (my boss is specialized in that area)
- The bases of Scrum
- Some new technologies as Vue.js or Mongodb
