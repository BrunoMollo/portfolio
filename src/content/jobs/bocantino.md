This was a freelance contract that I took with a friend.
Bocantino is a company that produce dog food, and needed a system to manage
the entry of ingredients and production.

We went though all the developing process, including:

- Requirement gathering
- Definition of scope and use cases
- Selection of tech stack
- Coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Documentation
- Responding to bugs and issues
